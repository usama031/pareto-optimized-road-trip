# Pareto-Optimized Road Trip

**Pareto-Optimized Road Trip** is a Python-based project that leverages Pareto optimization techniques to plan road trips with multiple conflicting objectives. The goal is to find the most efficient route that optimally balances several factors like travel time, fuel cost, and comfort, without sacrificing one for the other unnecessarily. This project uses multi-objective optimization to find a **Pareto Front**, allowing you to make well-informed trade-offs between competing objectives.

## Introduction

Planning a road trip often involves making trade-offs between multiple objectives: **time**, **cost**, and **comfort**. For example, you might choose to take a longer route to avoid traffic and have more scenic views, or you might prefer a faster route that costs more in fuel. **Pareto-Optimized Road Trip** uses Pareto efficiency to generate an optimal set of routes based on your preferences.

A Pareto optimal solution is one where no objective can be improved without making another one worse. This approach helps you find **trade-off solutions** where you can decide what is most important for you â€” whether it's minimizing cost, reducing travel time, or enhancing comfort.

This project uses data from various sources, including **Google Maps API**, **OpenStreetMap**, and **traffic data**, to calculate various possible routes, and then employs Pareto optimization to select the best one that meets your requirements.

## Features

- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Optimizes road trip planning by balancing time, fuel cost, and comfort (or any other objectives you define).
- **Pareto Front Generation**: Generates a set of "Pareto optimal" routes where no route is strictly better than another in all objectives.
- **Customizable Preferences**: Allows users to adjust the weight of objectives (e.g., prioritize time over cost, or comfort over fuel consumption).
- **Dynamic Re-Routing**: Real-time updates based on current traffic data and road conditions.
- **Route Visualization**: Visualize the optimal routes and trade-offs using interactive maps.
- **Cost Estimation**: Provides an estimated cost (in terms of fuel consumption or monetary cost) for each Pareto optimal route.
